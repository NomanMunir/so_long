AppArmor differs from some other MAC systems on Linux: it is path-based, it allows mixing of enforcement and complain mode profiles, it uses include files to ease development, 
and it has a far lower barrier to entry than other popular MAC systems.

AppArmor is an established technology first seen in Immunix and later integrated into Ubuntu, Novell/SUSE, and Mandriva. 


Core AppArmor functionality is in the mainline Linux kernel from 2.6.36 onwards; work is ongoing by AppArmor, Ubuntu and other developers to merge additional AppArmor functionality into the mainline kernel.
